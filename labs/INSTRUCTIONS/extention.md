## AIM: To run Terraform code in an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline using the Terraform extension, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Azure DevOps Environment

1. **Create an Azure DevOps Project**: If you donâ€™t already have one, create a new project in Azure DevOps.
   
2. **Install Terraform Extension**:
   - Go to the **Azure DevOps marketplace** and search for the **Terraform extension**.
   - Install the **Terraform** extension to your Azure DevOps organization. This extension will provide the necessary tasks for working with Terraform.

3. **Service Connection to Azure**:
   - In Azure DevOps, go to your project settings.
   - Under **Service connections**, create a new **Azure Resource Manager** service connection. This connection will be used by Terraform to authenticate and interact with Azure resources.


### Step 2: Create the YAML Pipeline

1. **Go to Pipelines** in Azure DevOps and create a new pipeline.
2. Choose **YAML** for the pipeline configuration.
3. Add the following sample YAML code to define the Terraform pipeline. This example assumes you're using the **Terraform Extension** in Azure DevOps.

### Example Pipeline YAML
go to left side pipeline option
click on `New Pipeline` the blue button on top right side
choose first option => azure repos git 
click on `eshoponweb`

### paste the below code

### click on save and run option on top right side


### Key Steps Breakdown:
- **Install Terraform Version**: If you need to install a specific version of Terraform, use the `UseTerraform@0` task to specify the version.
- **Terraform Init**: Initializes the Terraform working directory and configures the backend storage if needed (e.g., Azure Blob Storage).
- **Terraform Plan**: Prepares an execution plan. It checks what changes Terraform will apply to your infrastructure.
- **Terraform Apply**: Executes the changes in your Azure environment by applying the Terraform plan.
- **Terraform Output** (optional): Displays the output values from the Terraform configuration.


### Step 5: Trigger the Pipeline

1. After committing the YAML file, the pipeline should automatically trigger based on the trigger condition (e.g., on a push to the `main` branch).
2. Monitor the pipeline run to ensure the Terraform tasks execute correctly.

### Troubleshooting

- If Terraform isn't executing as expected, review the **Pipeline logs** to identify where the issue might be.
- Ensure that the Azure service connection (`azureSubscription`) has the correct permissions to manage the required Azure resources.
- If you're using an Azure Storage Account backend for Terraform state, make sure the storage account, container, and key are correctly set up.
