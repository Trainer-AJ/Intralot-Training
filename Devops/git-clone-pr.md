> how to clone a repository, edit the code after creating a branch, and create a pull request. Using Git and GitHub for this workflow. **Same commands can be used for Azure Repo**
---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. **check if git installed**
```sh
git --version
```

3. **Clone the Repository Locally**  
   Open your terminal (or Git Bash) and run the following command, replacing the URL with the one you copied:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Trainer-AJ/upload-code-here.git
   ```

   This will clone the repository to your local machine.

4. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository**  
   Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the directory of the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd upload-code-here
   ```


---

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

1. **Check Current Branch**  
   Before creating a new branch, it's good practice to check which branch you're currently on. Run:

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   This will show a list of all branches, and the active branch will have an asterisk (*) next to it. Typically, you should be on the `main` or `master` branch initially.

2. **Create a New Branch**  
   Now, let's create a new branch to work on. The branch name should be descriptive of the changes you're going to make. For example, if you're adding a new feature, you might call it `feature/add-login`.

   Run the following command to create a new branch and switch to it:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b terraform/your-name
   ```

   This creates and switches to a new branch called `terraform/your-name`.

3. **Create a folder here with your name**
```sh
mkdir your-name
```


---

### Step 3: Edit Code Locally

1. **Make Changes to the Code**  :
  


3. **Edit the Code**  
   

4. **Check the Status of Your Changes**  
   Once you're done editing the code, return to the terminal and run:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This will show the modified files that have been changed or added.

5. **Stage the Changes**  
   To stage the changes for commit, use the `git add` command:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   This stages all the changes. You can also stage specific files by replacing the `.` with the file path.

6. **Commit the Changes**  
   After staging your changes, commit them with a descriptive message. For example:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added new file"
   ```

---

### Step 4: Push Your Changes to GitHub

1. **Push the Changes to GitHub**  
   After committing, push your changes to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-login
   ```

2. **Verify Your Changes**  
   Go back to GitHub in your web browser and navigate to the repository. You should see your new branch listed under the "Branch" dropdown.

---

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request (PR)

1. **Navigate to the "Pull Requests" Tab**  
   On GitHub, go to the repositoryâ€™s main page. You'll see a tab labeled **Pull requests**. Click on it.

2. **Click "New Pull Request"**  
   On the Pull Requests page, click the green **New pull request** button.

3. **Select the Base and Compare Branches**  
   - **Base**: This is the branch you want your changes to be merged into. Typically, this will be `main` or `master`.
   - **Compare**: This is your newly created branch (e.g., `feature/add-login`).

   GitHub will automatically show the differences between the two branches.

4. **Write a Pull Request Description**  
   Write a title and description for your pull request, explaining what changes you made and why. Be clear and concise.

   Example PR title:
   ```
   Add login feature to the app
   ```

   Example PR description:
   ```
   - Added a login feature with email and password authentication.
   - Updated the authentication logic to integrate with the backend.
   ```

5. **Create the Pull Request**  
   After writing your description, click the green **Create pull request** button. This will open the PR for review.

---

### Step 6: Review and Merge the Pull Request

1. **Code Review**  
   If you're working with a team, someone (or yourself if you're the only one) will review the pull request. They can leave comments, request changes, or approve it.

2. **Merge the PR**  
   After the pull request is reviewed and approved, you (or the repository admin) can merge the pull request into the `main` branch by clicking the green **Merge pull request** button.

3. **Delete the Branch (Optional)**  
   After the pull request is merged, you can delete your feature branch from both your local machine and GitHub to keep things clean.

   - To delete the local branch:

     ```bash
     git branch -d feature/add-login
     ```

   - To delete the remote branch on GitHub:

     ```bash
     git push origin --delete feature/add-login
     ```

### Recap of the Workflow

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Create a new branch with `git checkout -b <branch-name>`.
3. Make your changes to the code.
4. Stage and commit the changes using `git add` and `git commit`.
5. Push the changes to GitHub with `git push origin <branch-name>`.
6. Create a pull request on GitHub, compare the branches, and submit the PR.
7. Review and merge the PR after it's been approved.
8. Optionally, delete the feature branch locally and remotely.

This workflow is common for collaborative projects where multiple developers are working on the same repository. Creating pull requests allows for code reviews, collaboration, and tracking of changes.
